About the Animation Demo files:
{note: TML is now shipping version 2.5 of their Pascal, believe it is
free to version 2.0 owners.  Fixes some stuff for the new System.  We
didn't have any trouble with 2.0 until we moved up to System 4.1.  The
package includes 'Edit' version 2.1.  'Edit' is also available from APDA..see
the MoreInfo.sit files.
**note: Watch out for the new print stuff and systems before 4.1!}

'Animation Steps' is a 'FullPaint' document that illustrates the steps
in getting graphics from a Paint program to animation on the screen...
document can be opened from most Paint type programs.

'Animation.Pas' is an 'Edit' text file containing pascal source
code to be compiled by the Pascal compiler.

'Anim.R' is an 'Edit' text file containing RMaker source code to
be compiled by RMaker.

'Anim/Rsrc' is a resource document containing resources built with
ResEdit, the resource editor.  These resources are 'included' when
Anim.R is compiled by RMaker.

'Animation' is our application... the result of Link.
